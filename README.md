# Auth0 Seeds feature oriented testing / proof of concept: end-to-end tests with Webdriver.io

## To run the tests

1. Make sure you have NodeJS, Java and Chrome installed in your system.
2. Clone the repo.
3. If you are running this under Windows, please delete the `chromedriver` file (the one without `.exe` extension).
4. Clone `https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-angularjs2-systemjs-sample.git` into the project's root, so you end up with a `auth0-angularjs2-systemjs-sample` folder in it.
5. Run in a new terminal: `npm install`
6. Run: `npm run test-suite` to run the tests. After the tests end, you can close the terminal by doing `Ctrl+C` multiple times.
